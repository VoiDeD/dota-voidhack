voidHack
=============

This is a proof of concept Dota 2 hack.

Zero support will be provided, so anyone looking to compile and use this is on their own. Same goes for VAC: use at your own peril!


## Features

* Auto Zeus Ult
	* Automatically looks for enemy players at low health and activates ult if doing so would secure a kill.
* Disables FoW (Fog-of-War)
	* Note: entities inside of FoW are not networked to the client, so the usefulness is limited.
* Better camera zoom
	* Allows you to zoom your camera out further.

## Todos

* Draw mana bar of enemy heroes
* Display the level of enemy heroes' abilities.
